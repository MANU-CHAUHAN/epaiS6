This session was about map, filter, zip, docstrings, annotations, lambda expression,
 functional introspection, callables etc. 

## **Assignment**
![poker](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/6b/1f/f7/6b1ff73716c14139c951241f3c1d7c46.jpg)

1. Write a single expression that includes lambda, zip and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck 
2. Write a normal function without using lambda, zip, and map function to create 52 cards in a deck 
3. Write a function that, when given 2 sets of 3 or 4 or 5 cards (1 game can only have 3 cards with each player or 4 cards or 5 cards per player) (1 deck of cards only), (2 players only), can identify who won the game of poker 

Given:
vals = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'jack', 'queen', 'king', 'ace']
suits = ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']

## Functions

### 1. create_deck_cards_using_lambda 
This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits using lambda and map function in a single line

```python
def create_deck_cards_using_lambda() -> list:
    """
    This function creates 52 cards in a deck using lambda, map, zip and list comprehension in a single expression

    returns: a list of tuples containing all card combinations i.e 4 suits of a deck
    """

    return list(
        card for new_suit in map(lambda one_suit: list(zip(vals, [one_suit] * len(vals))), suits) for card in new_suit)
```

### 2. create_deck_cards_normal_function
This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits without using lambda and map function
```python

def create_deck_cards_normal_function() -> list:
    """
    This function creates 52 cards in a deck using for loops

    returns: a list of tuples containing all card combinations i.e 4 suits of a deck
    """
    deck = []
    for suit in suits:
        for val in vals:
            deck.append((val, suit))
    return deck
```
## Rules followed for Poker:
#### Royal Flush : 
A, K, Q, J, 10, all the same suit for 5 cards.
A, K, Q, J, all the same suit for 4 cards.
A, K, Q, all the same suit for 3 cards.

#### Straight flush :
Cards in a sequence, all in the same suit.

#### Four of a kind :
Four cards of the same rank.
This is not applicable to set of 3 cards.

#### Full house :
Three of a kind with a pair.
This is not applicable to set of 3 or 4 cards.

#### Flush :
Any cards of the same suit, but not in a sequence.

#### Straight :
Cards in a sequence, but not of the same suit.

#### Three of a kind :
Three cards of the same rank.

#### Two pair :
Two different pairs.
This is not applicable to set of 3 cards.

#### One pair :
Two cards of the same rank.

#### High Card :
When you havenâ€™t made any of the hands above, the highest card from both set is compared.
